# Zero Trust Architecture for Secure Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
This course aims to equip participants with a comprehensive understanding of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) and its critical application in securing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The primary objective is to bridge the gap between cybersecurity principles and automotive engineering, enabling learners to design, implement, and maintain robust security frameworks for next-generation vehicles. Through a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical exercises, students will gain proficiency in applying Zero Trust principles to address the unique challenges posed by the complex, interconnected systems of CAVs, ultimately contributing to the development of safer and more secure autonomous transportation ecosystems.
