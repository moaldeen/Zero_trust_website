    "Traditional security measures like firewalls and user ID/password systems were once considered sufficient to protect corporate networks. However, these systems have proven vulnerable to cybercriminals who exploit stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access, leading to data theft, manipulation, or ransomware attacks. The shift towards remote work, personal devices, and cloud services has further complicated the security landscape, making the corporate network perimeter less relevant. Instead, securing individual identities has become paramount.\n",

    "- **Network:** Isolates sensitive resources by dynamically defining network access, deploying micro-segmentation techniques, and controlling network flows while encrypting end-to-end traffic.\n",
    "- **Application:** Secures access at the application layer by integrating user, device, and data components, and wrapping each workload and compute container to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.\n",
    "- **Data:** Focuses on securing and enforcing access to data based on its categorization and classification, isolating it from everyone except those who need access.\n",
    "- **Visibility and Analytics:** Provides insight into user and system behavior analytics by observing real-time communications between all Zero Trust components.\n",
    "- **Orchestration and Automation:** Automates security and network operational processes across the ZTA by orchestrating functions between similar and disparate security systems and applications."
