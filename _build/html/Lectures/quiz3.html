    "To create a secure perimeter around all network devices.",

  question: "Which of the following best describes the process of monitoring traffic across the protect surface in Zero Trust Architecture?",
  options: [
  "Tracking every packet that crosses the protect surface to understand and close security gaps.",
    "Monitoring only external threats that attempt to access the network.",
    "Focusing on user login attempts and password management.",
    
    "Using a single firewall to block all untrusted connections."

  question: "Which strategy is NOT recommended as part of the Zero Trust implementation strategy?",

    "Customizing the Zero Trust model to fit the specific needs of the organization.",

    "Using detailed rules, controls, and firewall policies to protect data.",

  question: "In Zero Trust Design, which factor is NOT typically considered in the dynamic and contextual process of authentication and authorization?",

    "Device health",
    "Time of access",
    
    "Location of the user",
    "User's personal interests"

  question: "In a Zero Trust model, what is the primary difference between on-site and remote users' access to network resources?",
  options: [
    "On-site users have unlimited access, while remote users are restricted.",
    "On-site users are implicitly trusted, whereas all users must be authenticated regardless of location.",
    "Remote users use VPNs, while on-site users do not.",
    "There is no difference; both follow the same stringent access controls."
