Also, provide just-in-time (JIT) access, allowing users to gain temporary elevated privileges when necessary for specific tasks\n","\n","### Key Functions of the **Devices** Pillar:\n","\n","- **IT Asset Management Software (ITAM):** manage and track IT assets, including devices, throughout their lifecycle. It helps in maintaining an accurate device inventory and ensuring compliance with security policies\n","\n","\n","- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: constantly monitor endpoint devices for suspicious activities, unusual behavior, and potential security threats.\n","\n","- **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**: Used to secure and enforce policies on smartphones and tablets.

This can be achieved using Software Defined Networking (SDN) solutions, which allow for dynamic and granular network segmentation\n","\n","- **Access Control:** Implementing role-based and attribute-based access controls ensures that users and devices have access only to the resources necessary for their roles.\n","\n","- **Encryption and Authentication:**  Ensuring that all data in transit is encrypted and using strong authentication mechanisms, such as multifactor authentication, helps protect against unauthorized access and data breaches\n","\n","\n","\n","### Key Functions of the **Applications & Workloads** Pillar:\n","\n","- **Identity and Policy-Based Access:** only authorized users can connect to authorized applications, eliminating lateral movement potential. This is achieved through app-specific authorization and outbound-only connections, which make applications invisible to unauthorized users.\n","\n","- **Security in Development Processes:** integrating security into software development and deployment practices. This includes using tools like GitHub Advanced Security and Microsoft Entra ID for secure access management and code remediation as part of the CI/CD and DevSecOps processes.\n","\n","- **Continuous Monitoring and Threat Protection:** Continuous application security monitoring and re-authorizing access to applications and services.\n","\n","- **Application Segmentation:** Segmentation of applications and services, including VMs and containers. (to be changed)\n","\n","### Key Functions of the **Data** Pillar:\n","https://www.vastdata.com/blog/deploying-a-data-pillar-within-the-zero-trust-architecture-framework\n","- **Data Categorization:** Classifying and labeling data to determine its sensitivity and the security controls needed is the first step.

This function ensures that sensitive information is shielded from unauthorized access and potential exfiltration.\n","\n","- **Data Encryption:** Encrypting sensitive data in transit and at rest with FIPS-validated algorithms protects it from unauthorized interception or access.\n","\n","- **Data Access Management:** Controlling and monitoring data access is imperative.

Throughout the migration period, they need to maintain strong security by ensuring that old and new components work together smoothly.\n","\n","- **Building robust data sources**: Another implementation challenge lies in collecting sufficient data to feed to the PE to enable reliable authentication decisions. This requires detailed knowledge of enterprise assets, subjects and business processes.  \n","\n","- **Securing policy components**: To prevent disruption to authentication processes and therefore business operations, organizations need to protect the PE, PA and PEP. They should be placed in a secure environment or replicated to several environments. In addition, they should be carefully monitored, with any configuration changes logged and audited.\n","\n","- **Fostering user acceptance**: Since Zero Trust requires minimizing permissions and requesting reauthentication for riskier access requests, users may experience frustration at the changes. To reduce security fatigue, be careful not to remove access rights that users actually need and require MFA only when it is warranted. More broadly, fostering a Zero Trust mindset by explaining the security benefits. It is also worth clearing up the misconception that \"Zero Trust\" means a lack of trust in employees as people; explain that it simply refers to not automatically trusting any device, system, user or other entity.\n","\n","- **Managing the right level of permissions**: Minimizing permissions is not equal to zero permissions, users will still have a set of permissions once they are authenticated but should not get all the permissions that are available. A Microsoft report from 2023 highlights a risky gap between permissions granted and permissions used in the cloud, as identities use just 1% of the permissions granted to them. To handle that, make sure that a user's role(s) and the granted permissions for that role are well-managed and reduced to the minimum possible. In addition, having a process in place that allows for either just-in-time exceptions or an audited self-service way of assigning the needed right will make operations of zero trust easier."],"metadata":{"id":"OQ2YU7Ttqbs1"}}]}
