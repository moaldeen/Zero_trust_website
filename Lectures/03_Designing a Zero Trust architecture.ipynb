No two Zero Trust security architectures will ever be the same.\n","\n","\n","1. **Identify your “protect surface”**\n","Your “protect surface” is everything you want to protect. It contains all of your business’s digital assets, including your sensitive or proprietary data, your Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Access files, your line-of-business and accounting apps, and your CRM data. You can assume that everything outside of your protect surface is unsecured.\n","\n","  It’s usually pretty easy to ID what your most sensitive data is and many organizations can figure out their top assets and apps… but you may need some help figuring out what your crucial IT services are.\n","\n","2. **Watch how traffic moves across your protect surface**\n","Next, you need to get a good idea of who or what is accessing your data, and why. Remember, “traffic” is more than just people – it’s also all the other apps, services, and data that access or link to the items in your protect surface. All those little interdependency details are what create the backdoors and security loopholes you’ll want to close up.\n","\n","  To do this best, you’ll want to monitor every packet that moves across your protect surface. That way, you can determine the source of those packets and close any gaps in your overall cybersecurity. After completing this step, you’ll understand which traffic makes sense for your needs and which traffic is suspicious.\n","\n","3. **Ensure that your protect surface evolves with your data**\n","Your Zero Trust protect surface guards your sensitive data with extra security measures, keeping your data safe on any device and in any location. As your data grows day-by-day, your protect surface should also grow with that expanding data. To keep your protect surface growing properly, you’ll need to design and implement a Zero Trust plan that includes detailed rules, controls, permissions (ACL changes), firewall policies, and more.\n","\n","4. **Create Your Zero Trust Archtiture Policies**\n","Once the ZTA is designed, the next step is to create your ZTA policies to determine who or what should have access to your protect surfaces.\n","  A good way to begin drafting up ZTA policies is to follow Kipling’s method, which covers who, what, when, where, why, and how to design contextual-based policies\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://github.com/moaldeen/trustzone/blob/main/Kipling%20Method.png?raw=true\" alt=\"sup-learning.png\" width=\"60%\"></center>\n","\n","5. **Monitor & Maintain**\n","Once everything is designed and in place, the next step is to monitor and maintain your ZTA to help you fine tune and improve your ZTA over time. Zero Trust is an iterative process, so you should always be looking for ways to make improvements in your ZTA. Zero Trust is adaptive, so your ZTA should be as well.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"MiwSUnkQEoPw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Exploring ZTA Use Cases"],"metadata":{"id":"P1_MErJPIaCI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### VPN-Less Implementation\n","\n","VPN\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://github.com/moaldeen/trustzone/blob/main/vpn.png?raw=true\" alt=\"sup-learning.png\" width=\"60%\"></center>\n","\n","- On-site users have implicit trust.\n","\n","- VPN users are given full access.\n","\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://github.com/moaldeen/trustzone/blob/main/vpn-less.png?raw=true\" alt=\"sup-learning.png\" width=\"60%\"></center>\n","\n","- Follows the same access process for all users.\n","- Since there’s no implicit trust, a VPN connection not needed\n"],"metadata":{"id":"_Vs60LQMI8vI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## East-West Segmentation"],"metadata":{"id":"HOXVyOnzVuMJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","### Conventional Design\n","<center><img src=\"https://github.com/moaldeen/trustzone/blob/main/internet.png?raw=true\" alt=\"sup-learning.png\" width=\"60%\"></center>\n","\n","- Intranets generally have a level of implicit trust.\n","\n","- Implicit trust makes lateral movement possible.\n","\n","\n","### Zero Trust Design\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://github.com/moaldeen/trustzone/blob/main/Zero-trust-firewall.png?raw=true\" alt=\"sup-learning.png\" width=\"60%\"></center>\n","\n","- Designed to prevent lateral movement.\n","\n","- Limits the blast radius of an attack."],"metadata":{"id":"nT01uWJXfdgp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Secure Access From Anywhere"],"metadata":{"id":"jJotgXS850sz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<center><img src=\"https://github.com/moaldeen/trustzone/blob/main/anywhere_secure.png?raw=true\" alt=\"sup-learning.png\" width=\"60%\"></center>\n","\n","\n","\n","- **Identity Governance** focuses on identity management and access control.\n","- **Application Micro-Segmentation** places micro perimeters around trusted resources.\n","- **Software-Defined Networking** forms context-aware virtual networks for our assets at the network layer."],"metadata":{"id":"NjuWMNDq54fM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Conditional Authentication & Authorization\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"i0ehGR659mlq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Conventional Design\n","\n","Authentication and authorization is granted based on\n","location, role, username/password, PKI, and two-factor\n","authentication:\n","\n","\n","  - Virtual Private Network (VPN)\n","\n","  - Trusted Network Location (Intranet)\n","\n","  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\n","\n","\n","\n","### Zero Trust Design\n","\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://github.com/moaldeen/trustzone/blob/main/Authentication_Authorization.png?raw=true\" alt=\"sup-learning.png\" width=\"60%\"></center>\n","\n","\n","- Utilizes a much more robust dynamic and contextual process.\n","- Considers device health, location, time, behavior, etc.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"JlTWz-Fi97x6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Microsoft Zero Trust Step by Step"],"metadata":{"id":"OOYGozMu99n5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/01/19/using-zero-trust-principles-to-protect-against-sophisticated-attacks-like-solorigate/\n","<center><img src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Zero-Trust-marketecture-products-004.jpg\" alt=\"sup-learning.png\" width=\"60%\"></center>\n"],"metadata":{"id":"UkzSBuOZEvQE"}}]}
