      "Traditional firewall approaches are sufficient for vehicles due to their isolated network design.",
      "Continuous authentication and authorization across all sensors and ECUs are required.",
      "ZTA eliminates the need for encryption in vehicle communication.",

  question: "Which of the following is NOT a core tenet of Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA) as applied to Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs)?",
  options: [
      "All data sources and computing services are considered resources.",
      "Continuous monitoring and validation of security posture.",
      "Access to resources is determined by dynamic policies.",
      "Access to resources is based on the vehicle's physical location."

  question: "In a segmented CAN bus system using the hub-and-spoke model, which of the following best describes the role of the Zero-Trust (ZT) controller?",
  options: [
  "It manages communication between the central hub and spokes, enforcing security policies.",
 "It acts as a firewall to block external attacks on the CAN bus.",
      "It authenticates all internal devices without communication oversight.",
      "It directly encrypts all CAN bus messages without requiring verification."

      "Encrypting data flows between different ECUs in the vehicle.",
      "Monitoring and authenticating devices through manual review.",
      "Verifying a device based on pre-registered characteristics and traffic patterns.",

  ],
  correct: 2
},
{
  question: "In the context of Zero Trust for CAVs, what is the primary function of a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)?",
  options: [
    "To encrypt all communications between the vehicle's components in real-time.",
    "To monitor and control access to resources by enforcing real-time security decisions.",
    "To log all communications within the vehicle's network for security auditing.",
    "To act as a secondary channel for secure communications when the primary network is compromised."
